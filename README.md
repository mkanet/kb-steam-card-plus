## Installation

### Prerequisites
You need at least one [steam integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/steam_online/) to use with this card.

### HACS (recommended)

1. Go to the Community Store.
2. Search for `steam card`.
3. Press `Install`.

### Manual Installation

```yaml
resources:
  url: '<url-to-card.js>'
  type: module
```

## Usage

for a single user card, use `entity`:

```yaml
entity: sensor.steam_<steam-id>
type: 'custom:kb-steam-card'
```

you can change the username using the following:

```yaml
entity: sensor.steam_<steam-id>
friendly_name: Myself
type: 'custom:kb-steam-card'
```

for multiple users, use the `entities` attribute:

```yaml
entities:
  - sensor.steam_<steam-id>
  - sensor.steam_<steam-id>
  - sensor.steam_<steam-id>
type: 'custom:kb-steam-card'
```

you can also use a prefix selector to select all steam sensors:

```yaml
type: 'custom:kb-steam-card'
entities: sensor.steam_
```

to show only **online users**, add the `online_only` attribute:

```yaml
type: 'custom:kb-steam-card'
entities: sensor.steam_
online_only: true
```

you can also show the game header image as background with `game_background: true`:

```yaml
entities:
  - sensor.steam_<steam-id>
  - sensor.steam_<steam-id>
  - sensor.steam_<steam-id>
friendly_name: hello
game_background: true
type: 'custom:kb-steam-card'
```
